** Which Encog JAR File to Use ** 

In this directory you will see two .jar files for use with Encog.  


The JAR files will be named as follows.

encog-core-x.y.z.jar
encog-engine-x.y.z.jar 

You may be wondering which one to use?  Most likely, you will want 
to use the core.  This is the complete Encog framework.  The 
Engine contains only the low-level calculation parts of Encog.  
Other A.I. frameworks will sometimes use just the engine to augment
their own calculation capabilities.

If you are just using the Engine or Core, you must also include the following
JAR, it allows the Engine to make use of the GPU.

JOCL-0.1.3a-beta.jar

The core also requires the following two JAR's for logging.

slf4j-api-1.5.6.jar     
slf4j-jdk14-1.5.6.jar
