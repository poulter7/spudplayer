/**
 * SampleSearchLightGamer is a simple state-machine-based Gamer. It will,
 * to the best of its ability, never pick a move which will give its opponent
 * a possible one-move win. It will also spend up to two seconds looking for
 * one-move wins it can take. This makes it slightly more challenging than the
 * RandomGamer, while still playing reasonably fast.
 * 
 * Essentially, it has a one-move search-light that it shines out, allowing it
 * to avoid moves that are immediately terrible, and also choose moves that are
 * immediately excellent.
 * 
 * This approach implicitly assumes that it is playing an alternating-play game,
 * which is not always true. It will play simultaneous-action games less well.
 * It also assumes that it is playing a zero-sum game, where its opponent will
 * always force it to lose if given that option.
 * 
 * This player is fairly good at games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Knight Fight, and Connect Four.
 * This player is pretty terrible at most games.
