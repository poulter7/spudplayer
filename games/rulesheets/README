Heya,

Some quick notes on the "games/rulesheets/" directory. I am slowly moving the
project to using web-based game repositories (plus aggressive caching, so that
you can still play games off-line). As a result, having an extensive collection
of rulesheets packaged into the GGP Base project is no longer necessary, since
better and more up-to-date versions of these games can be pulled down from the
web-based repository servers as needed.

So: this directory is now useful only for experimenting with one's own games,
that don't need to leave the local machine. I have left some sample test cases
that I put together, along with a few real games as examples. All of the apps
in the GGP Base package should support loading rulesheets from this directory,
though not all functionality will be enabled: e.g. you won't be able to publish
matches for online spectators to view.
