Note about GGP-Base:
The project contains the entire source of the project GGP-Base a GGP framework constructed by Sam Schreiber and editted somewhat by the author of this project. Later iterations of this may simply package GGP-Base but as Sam has chosen to distribute the project as source and not packaged, it remains in source for easy editting.
